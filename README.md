## About

This project is a part of #genuary32nd.

This is a modified version of day 6 "Steal Like an Artist", stealing from "Giant Steps" by rudxane: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/12643

I decided his Giant Steps were too small and needed to be Gianter!!

## Running

The files you need are...

```

...spin up a local webserver or just opening index.html should do the trick, see instructions.md for, well, instructions.
